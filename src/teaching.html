									<li>She was a great professor</li>
									<li>None to add</li>
									<li>Ivanna is a great teacher who thoroughly explains all the subjects! She also cares about her students and helps them achieve their grades. If you
										go to her class in person, you will succeed in her class.</li>
									<li>this was by far one of my favorite professors! she is super kind and helpful towards her students!</li>
									<li>Good teacher, very helpful with giving real world examples. Many opportunities for EC and help with homework</li>
									<li>This class was not too difficult, but I feel like the instructor could've done better in some places. I have a different learning style than what
										was used so I think that also impacted my experience. I liked the examples she used and how she related them to things in our demographic.</li>
									<li>She is amazing!</li>
									<li>Instructor was great very nice and helpful.</li>
									<li>Was extremely available for questions and review- paper reviews were also extremely helpful. Would not have done as well in this class without her
									</li>
									<li>Course content was taken really really slow.</li>
									<li>My favorite Professor by far!</li>
									<li>I appreciated how Ivanna would switch her teaching style when she could tell we were struggling. I also thought class was enjoyable and went at a
										great pace</li>

								<ul>
									<li>This course, while difficult at times, was wonderful. Ivanna was accessible at reasonable times and made it extremely clear what her expectations
										were. If you met these expectations, she would be willing to work with you.</li>
									<li>Very easy to communicate with and helpful throughout the course.</li>
									<li>Really enjoyed the professor's teaching style!</li>
									<li>Needs a smaller classroom in order to hear the lecture.</li>
									<li>Class went great!</li>
									<li>Mrs. Tindle was a great professor and I learned so much from her. She gave me a great foundation for economics and I look forward to taking
										Business Economics next semester after taking ECO 2305 with Mrs. Tindle.</li>
									<li>Like that</li>
									<li>She lacked the finishing touch of some confidence but was a great and nice professor overall. I see this professor changing students' lives over
										time.</li>
									<li>I enjoyed this class and all I learned from the instructor.</li>
									<li>Ms. Tindle is a very amazing person, but when it comes to teaching she struggles to explain concepts in ways that students will understand it.
										There were many times where I was super lost in class because of how she explained/showed us how to do things. I was very happy with the SI sessions,
										and most of the review notes that she posted before the test. I feel like if she were to put the formulas on the test/allow us to use them without
										having to memorize them, it would be much easier.</li>
									<li>She was a great professor and teacher and took the time to ensure we learned the material.</li>
									<li>This class started off not the best, but she asked for feedback and the class gave it to her, after that the class did start improving. Still not
										the best class but better than the beginning of the year.</li>
									<li>Good teacher and environment, I learned a lot more than I thought I would and had a good time in this class.</li>
									<li>Ivanna is very passionate about economics and truly strives to foster a productive learning environment. She makes time to thoroughly explain
										topics during her office hours when we visit. She used relevant applications in her lectures, and was always wanting to improve the way she approached
										the class. She needs to work on her oratory skills and delivery of some of the material. Overall, I enjoyed watching Ivanna grow as an instructor.
									</li>
									<li>Liked the course and loved the teacher thank you for a great semester. </li>
									<li>You can tell she is a new professor. I will say at the start of the semester it didn't seem like she cared too much about the class and cared more
										about her own classes, but a lot of the explanations lack in-depth explanations and are very minimal and the exams are somewhat difficult and worded
										odd compared to the material that is given in class. She is not a bad teacher but if she just went more in-depth about a lot of important concepts she
										would definitely be a great professor.</li>
									<li>Professor speaks too low. You can tell she's only teaching because it's a part of her degree most likely. She pulls up a slide and reads it
										basically. This is going to be the only class I get a B in because she's a horrible teacher and her class exam average is failing basically.</li>
									<li> I would really enjoy a meeting with the director of Economics to discuss this class further.</li>
									<li>The instructor seemed very nice. I thought she wasn't very good at demanding attention, and not in a disrespectful way, but you have to talk louder
										and more clearly, especially nowadays with the distractions that students have. I had a problem with the way she responded to a question in class one
										time when a student simply asked "Is there any extra credit," she could have just said no, instead she made an example out of the student and said "If
										you studied and did the reviews and paid attention in class and did the homework, then you wouldn't have to ask that.</li>
									<li>The instructor was not the best teacher but was slowly improving over the course of the semester. I think there were sometimes where you would be
										talking about something and not give enough examples over a specific subject. For me it was examples of different GDP situations.</li>
									<li>Ivanna doesn't know how to teach economics. I pretty much taught myself the entire thing. Thankfully I had a background in econ beforehand or I
										would have failed. She overcomplicated just about every topic and made it ten times harder to learn and retain. Econ is already a challenge for some
										and she made it a nightmare.</li>
									<li>Instructor Tindle was very good, there was noticeable progression through the semester in her teaching schedule.</li>
									<li>The first few weeks were rough because she was so quiet, but she has found a good groove.</li>
									<li>Ms. Tindle was not the best professor for this course. I understand that it was her first time teaching the course and that she is also a student,
										but she did not do a good job teaching economics this semester. I know that she has a good comprehension of economics, but that doesn't mean she can
										teach it. She was also very passive-aggressive during class when teaching. None of the students were engaged because she would many times contradict
										things that she would say about the same topic and not know how to explain topics. When teaching us a new chapter, she would only teach the basics and
										then test us on very difficult contents. It was a frustrating course to take because economics shouldn't be as hard as she made it. I had to spend
										hours upon hours going to SI sessions because she did not teach us well enough to prepare for her own exams. I would also like to add a critique for
										the department as a whole. I think for the next semester, every professor should have to teach the same chapters at the same time because many times
										during SI sessions, every student would be learning something different so the SI instructor had trouble figuring out what to teach us. And everyone
										should take the same chapter tests because it is not fair for students to all take different midterm exams, then to all go and take the same common
										final.</li>
									<li>This was a fairly okay course. I feel like the teaching barrier between classes and test was a huge difference. I'm glad I have had a background of
										some economics because this class was a lot of being self-taught.</li>
									<li>This instructor did not seem quite ready to teach this class this semester. She seemed confused on some of the material she was teaching and
										demonstrated examples in class wrong multiple times throughout the semester. Her material was extremely abstract, while her tests were extremely
										specific and difficult. Almost every test score across this class had a 10% or lower median score than my financial accounting class's median test
										scores. Even with these scores this professor never offered any extra credit and would curve tests just enough so that the median score of every test
										was not failing. This class very much felt like a learning experience for a first-year professor and not a learning experience for students. Overall,
										lectures were borderline useless tests were very tough.</li>
									<li>I'm not this honest but I feel a need to be. This course was possibly one of the worst ones I've taken at tech. This professor seriously needs to
										revise her way of teaching and presenting information. She did the absolute minimum to teach us and that reflected in our grades. First off she did
										not provide a course schedule until we were well into class. Secondly, on top of her speaking so softly it was hard to hear what she was saying, she
										also had horrible handwriting and had the presentation very uninteresting to learn. She also has a very apparent lack of empathy for students, which
										is especially surprising considering that she is a student herself. She refuses to make exceptions on assignments even when citing serious reasons
										that you were unable to do the assignment. I personally was going through something very personal to me and was unable to do an assignment and she
										showed no empathy whatsoever. There is a lot more to express when it comes to this teacher, however, I digress. I sincerely hope she changes so her
										future students can have a better education.</li>
									<li>Class notes didn't always reflect material on the test. The teacher would spend 30 minutes on an example and forget how to do it and would say "I'm
										just going to take this off the test" and it was in fact still on the test. This is just one example out of the many.</li>
									<li>Her lectures made little to no sense and her tests did not match the overall concepts covered in class.</li>
