									<li>She was a great professor</li>
									<li>None to add</li>
									<li>Ivanna is a great teacher who thoroughly explains all the subjects! She also cares about her students and helps them achieve their grades. If you
										go to her class in person, you will succeed in her class.</li>
									<li>this was by far one of my favorite professors! she is super kind and helpful towards her students!</li>
									<li>Good teacher, very helpful with giving real world examples. Many opportunities for EC and help with homework</li>
									<li>This class was not too difficult, but I feel like the instructor could've done better in some places. I have a different learning style than what
										was used so I think that also impacted my experience. I liked the examples she used and how she related them to things in our demographic.</li>
									<li>She is amazing!</li>
									<li>Instructor was great very nice and helpful.</li>
									<li>Was extremely available for questions and review- paper reviews were also extremely helpful. Would not have done as well in this class without her
									</li>
									<li>Course content was taken really really slow.</li>
									<li>My favorite Professor by far!</li>
									<li>I appreciated how Ivanna would switch her teaching style when she could tell we were struggling. I also thought class was enjoyable and went at a
										great pace</li>

								<ul>
									<li>This course, while difficult at times, was wonderful. Ivanna was accessible at reasonable times and made it extremely clear what her expectations
										were. If you met these expectations, she would be willing to work with you.</li>
									<li>Very easy to communicate with and helpful throughout the course.</li>
									<li>Really enjoyed the professor's teaching style!</li>
									<li>Needs a smaller classroom in order to hear the lecture.</li>
									<li>Class went great!</li>
									<li>Mrs. Tindle was a great professor and I learned so much from her. She gave me a great foundation for economics and I look forward to taking
										Business Economics next semester after taking ECO 2305 with Mrs. Tindle.</li>
									<li>Like that</li>
									<li>She lacked the finishing touch of some confidence but was a great and nice professor overall. I see this professor changing students' lives over
										time.</li>
									<li>I enjoyed this class and all I learned from the instructor.</li>
									<li>Ms. Tindle is a very amazing person, but when it comes to teaching she struggles to explain concepts in ways that students will understand it.
										There were many times where I was super lost in class because of how she explained/showed us how to do things. I was very happy with the SI sessions,
										and most of the review notes that she posted before the test. I feel like if she were to put the formulas on the test/allow us to use them without
										having to memorize them, it would be much easier.</li>
									<li>She was a great professor and teacher and took the time to ensure we learned the material.</li>
									<li>This class started off not the best, but she asked for feedback and the class gave it to her, after that the class did start improving. Still not
										the best class but better than the beginning of the year.</li>
									<li>Good teacher and environment, I learned a lot more than I thought I would and had a good time in this class.</li>
									<li>Ivanna is very passionate about economics and truly strives to foster a productive learning environment. She makes time to thoroughly explain
										topics during her office hours when we visit. She used relevant applications in her lectures, and was always wanting to improve the way she approached
										the class. She needs to work on her oratory skills and delivery of some of the material. Overall, I enjoyed watching Ivanna grow as an instructor.
									</li>
									<li>Liked the course and loved the teacher thank you for a great semester. </li>
									<li>You can tell she is a new professor. I will say at the start of the semester it didn't seem like she cared too much about the class and cared more
										about her own classes, but a lot of the explanations lack in-depth explanations and are very minimal and the exams are somewhat difficult and worded
										odd compared to the material that is given in class. She is not a bad teacher but if she just went more in-depth about a lot of important concepts she
										would definitely be a great professor.</li>
									<li>Professor speaks too low. You can tell she's only teaching because it's a part of her degree most likely. She pulls up a slide and reads it
										basically. This is going to be the only class I get a B in because she's a horrible teacher and her class exam average is failing basically.</li>
									<li> I would really enjoy a meeting with the director of Economics to discuss this class further.</li>
									<li>The instructor seemed very nice. I thought she wasn't very good at demanding attention, and not in a disrespectful way, but you have to talk louder
										and more clearly, especially nowadays with the distractions that students have. I had a problem with the way she responded to a question in class one
										time when a student simply asked "Is there any extra credit," she could have just said no, instead she made an example out of the student and said "If
										you studied and did the reviews and paid attention in class and did the homework, then you wouldn't have to ask that.</li>
									<li>The instructor was not the best teacher but was slowly improving over the course of the semester. I think there were sometimes where you would be
										talking about something and not give enough examples over a specific subject. For me it was examples of different GDP situations.</li>
									<li>Ivanna doesn't know how to teach economics. I pretty much taught myself the entire thing. Thankfully I had a background in econ beforehand or I
										would have failed. She overcomplicated just about every topic and made it ten times harder to learn and retain. Econ is already a challenge for some
										and she made it a nightmare.</li>
									<li>Instructor Tindle was very good, there was noticeable progression through the semester in her teaching schedule.</li>
									<li>The first few weeks were rough because she was so quiet, but she has found a good groove.</li>
									<li>Ms. Tindle was not the best professor for this course. I understand that it was her first time teaching the course and that she is also a student,
										but she did not do a good job teaching economics this semester. I know that she has a good comprehension of economics, but that doesn't mean she can
										teach it. She was also very passive-aggressive during class when teaching. None of the students were engaged because she would many times contradict
										things that she would say about the same topic and not know how to explain topics. When teaching us a new chapter, she would only teach the basics and
										then test us on very difficult contents. It was a frustrating course to take because economics shouldn't be as hard as she made it. I had to spend
										hours upon hours going to SI sessions because she did not teach us well enough to prepare for her own exams. I would also like to add a critique for
										the department as a whole. I think for the next semester, every professor should have to teach the same chapters at the same time because many times
										during SI sessions, every student would be learning something different so the SI instructor had trouble figuring out what to teach us. And everyone
										should take the same chapter tests because it is not fair for students to all take different midterm exams, then to all go and take the same common
										final.</li>
									<li>This was a fairly okay course. I feel like the teaching barrier between classes and test was a huge difference. I'm glad I have had a background of
										some economics because this class was a lot of being self-taught.</li>
									<li>This instructor did not seem quite ready to teach this class this semester. She seemed confused on some of the material she was teaching and
										demonstrated examples in class wrong multiple times throughout the semester. Her material was extremely abstract, while her tests were extremely
										specific and difficult. Almost every test score across this class had a 10% or lower median score than my financial accounting class's median test
										scores. Even with these scores this professor never offered any extra credit and would curve tests just enough so that the median score of every test
										was not failing. This class very much felt like a learning experience for a first-year professor and not a learning experience for students. Overall,
										lectures were borderline useless tests were very tough.</li>
									<li>I'm not this honest but I feel a need to be. This course was possibly one of the worst ones I've taken at tech. This professor seriously needs to
										revise her way of teaching and presenting information. She did the absolute minimum to teach us and that reflected in our grades. First off she did
										not provide a course schedule until we were well into class. Secondly, on top of her speaking so softly it was hard to hear what she was saying, she
										also had horrible handwriting and had the presentation very uninteresting to learn. She also has a very apparent lack of empathy for students, which
										is especially surprising considering that she is a student herself. She refuses to make exceptions on assignments even when citing serious reasons
										that you were unable to do the assignment. I personally was going through something very personal to me and was unable to do an assignment and she
										showed no empathy whatsoever. There is a lot more to express when it comes to this teacher, however, I digress. I sincerely hope she changes so her
										future students can have a better education.</li>
									<li>Class notes didn't always reflect material on the test. The teacher would spend 30 minutes on an example and forget how to do it and would say "I'm
										just going to take this off the test" and it was in fact still on the test. This is just one example out of the many.</li>
									<li>Her lectures made little to no sense and her tests did not match the overall concepts covered in class.</li>

									<li>The homeworks. It not only tested my knowledge of the required material but also further made sure I understood it.</li>
									<li>Your mock exams on blackboard were helpful because it prepared me for the actual exam. Made the real exam less scary and more familiar.</li>
									<li>I liked the way the lectures were organized.</li>
									<li>I sat towards the front rather than me usually sitting in the back. This allowed me to focus more. Focusing more on the lecture while also having
										the slides on blackboard were very beneficial.</li>
									<li>The most effect aspects were lectures</li>
									<li>Having a professor that believes in you & sets you up for success</li>
									<li>The review and days before the test she did a super good job explaining.</li>
									<li>Homeworks</li>
									<li>Extra credit opportunities</li>
									<li>The teacher was really good</li>
									<li>In terms of my learning the most effective aspects of this course were the homework and practice exams. The homework was 50 questions a piece and
										although they were long I feel that amount of questions gave me the opportunity to grasp the concept. The practice exam closely resembled the exams so
										I really think that helped me in properly understanding the correct concepts needed for the actual exam.</li>
									<li>The professor made the concepts easy</li>
									<li>Very good slides and extra material</li>
									<li>The most effective aspect of the course was the consistency of the schedule and the platform that the homework was offered on. Also, the reviews
										were very helpful for learning and understanding the connections of the material.</li>
									<li>Notes in class because the instructor helped make it clear to people if they didn’t fully understand the notes.</li>
									<li>The review sheets and reference guides</li>
									<li>The practice tests and review sheets because they showed the most accurate things on the test</li>
									<li>Bonus assignments</li>

									<li>I enjoyed this class.</li>
									<li>Good instructor made it easy to understand and made class engaging.</li>
									<li>goat.</li>
									<li>She put a lot of time into the slides and giving us ample opportunity for extra credit, but in a way we were learning the material better which I
										appreciated. She really cared about the class and that was nice. Overall she did a good job.</li>
									<li>She knows her stuff about economics and makes class engaging</li>
									<li>My favorite this semester</li>
									<li>She is very understanding and I am so appreciative of her help towards students and her reviews. I just did not appreciate the in-class lecture
										style.</li>
									<li>Overall good professor, loved the way she talked, it helped me understand what was confusing better.</li>
									<li>A good number of questions on the test reviews have wrong answers and are not fixed until the day of exam and makes everything confusing.</li>
									<li>Well-spoken and easy to understand.</li>
									<li>I learned more from the teacher that filled in for her one day when she was sick then I did the whole semester from her, extremely slow talker
										which made it miserable to try and pay attention, messed up the answers on all of her reviews</li>
									<li>Thank you for a good year.</li>
									<li>None</li>
									<li>Super professional and entertaining, it isnt easy to keep economics interesting, but she did a great job.</li>
									<li>Great professor who you can tell wanted to help us.</li>
									<li>I know she is new, so I hope she has a more successful semester in the spring.</li>
									<li>N/A</li>
									<li>Overall she is a nice person but it seemed like she didnt have a good grasp on what she was teaching. For example, she had the wrong answers marked right on several questions on all of the test reviews she gave out. This made the tests super confusing. On of the girls I talked to in the class said she brought the test reviews to the Econ help desk and they confirmed that the answers where wrong. Its genuinely a miracle that I scored as high as I did on the exams. Hopefully she can fix those mistakes if she teaches the course again.</li>
									<li>know what you are talking about.</li>
									<li>helpful and understanding</li>
									<li>Very good</li>
									<li>Great!</li>
									<li>Good instructor that gave us plenary of resources needed for success and responded to emails very quickly.</li>
