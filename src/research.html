              <p class="card-text text-left"> 	 Education plays a vital role in shaping society, making it essential to evaluate policies for their effectiveness. Effective policies should boost student success rather than hinder students' progress or waste resources. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), signed into law in 2015, aimed to address the shortcomings of its predecessor, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). NCLB was extensively researched and criticized for its strict national accountability requirements. In contrast, ESSA shifted the burden of the accountability determination to the states; however, the effectiveness of ESSA remains under-researched. This paper aims to evaluate the ESSA’s effect on student performance by leveraging variation in state implementation timelines. I develop a cohort-based model integrating differences-in-differences and event study methodologies. Student performance data includes National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) and ACT/SAT scores from 2006 to 2022 across all 50 states. Results indicate mixed outcomes: insignificant positive effects on college entrance exams and insignificant negative effects on fourth and eighth graders. The lack of statistically significant improvements suggests that ESSA has not yet achieved its goal of improving education outcomes.

          <h5 class="card-title">The Economics Undergraduate Degree </h5>
          <p class="card-text text-left"> This was my undergraduate thesis. It considered the economics undergraduate degree and how it prepared students for the future. Their future in a business, law, or economics. The research was primarily to synthesis the past research and consider the possible incentives and implications of the different decisions made. The primary attribute was the gap between mathematics required in undergraduate programs compared to the math required before entrance to an economics graduate program. </p>
