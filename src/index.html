						<p> During my time at TTU, I have been a Teaching Assistant and an instructor for a variety of different economics courses. All the courses and their evaluations (if possible) are listed <a
								href="teaching.html">on my teaching page</a>. I thoroughly enjoy teaching even when students don't enjoy learning. As an instructor, my one goal is to make sure each
							student finishes the course having learned something about economics. I have created my own materials for teaching based on the textbook and the course specifics, <a href="teaching_tools.html">here</a> I share some examples. </p>

I have also shared some of the tools I have created for teaching on <a href="teaching_tools.html">my teaching tools page</a>. For economics students first-time with R and latex, I created an simplified explanation of terms <a href="coding_explain.html"> viewable on dedicated page.</a> </p>
